Malaria Cell Detector
Overview

The Malaria Cell Detector is a machine learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect malaria-infected cells from images. This project leverages TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to build and train a CNN model on a dataset of over 27,000 cell images. The model achieves over 90% accuracy on both training and validation datasets and 85% accuracy on the test dataset.

The project also demonstrates various advanced concepts including subclassing, functional API, custom layers, evaluation, callbacks, checkpoints, data augmentation, and custom loss and metric methods. Visualization of training and validation accuracy and loss is provided to analyze model performance.
